Hi, I'm Šimon Tóth, an ex-Software Engineer and ex-Researcher. After leaving the commercial world behind, I'm now on a mission to share my 20 years' worth of Software Engineering experience with the world.

Since I create a lot of repositories, usually as companions to various articles, here is a quick summary of what's worth your time.

## A Complete Guide to Standard C++ Algorithms

[HappyCerberus/book-cpp-algorithms](https://github.com/HappyCerberus/book-cpp-algorithms)

This CC-BY-SA-NC book covers all C++ standard algorithms in an example-oriented style.

## The Daily bit(e) of C++ series

[HappyCerberus/daily-bite-cpp](https://github.com/HappyCerberus/daily-bite-cpp)

This is a directory for the Daily bit(e) of C++ series posts (starting 2nd Jan 2023). The series presents Modern C++ information in a digestible bite-sized format.
