### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

*You have stummbled upon the profile of me, Simon Toth. I'm a senior (mostly) C++ dev that loves to learn new things.*

For that purpose I have been streaming over the weekends, with my current two projects being a Sudoku Solver (pure C++, including the HTML front-end part, that's asmjs) and Stream Bot (currently Typescript).

I have started in the industry in 2004, so I have seen many things that I'm happy to chat about, including my original specialization (Distributed Systems) turning into a "building legos" type of affair.

When I'm not streaming, I do love a good (audio)book or a boardgame.
