Hi, I'm ≈†imon T√≥th, an ex-Software Engineer and ex-Researcher. After leaving the commercial world behind, I'm now on a mission to share my 20 years' worth of Software Engineering experience with the world.

Since I create a lot of repositories, usually as companions to various articles, here is a quick summary of what's worth your time.

## üìò A Complete Guide to Standard C++ Algorithms

The standard algorithms offer a lot of functionality. Save yourself time and effort by having a good grasp on what functionality already exists in the standard library.

## üìò Surviving the C++ Coding Interview

Learn the fundamental concepts behind coding interview problems. Train using a companion GitHub repository in a zero-setup DevContainer. All with modern C++ techniques.

## üìÑ The Daily bit(e) of C++ series

[HappyCerberus/daily-bite-cpp](https://github.com/HappyCerberus/daily-bite-cpp)

This is a directory for the Daily bit(e) of C++ series posts (starting 2nd Jan 2023). The series presents Modern C++ information in a digestible bite-sized format.
